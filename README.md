**`Tinkerer (Developer/Keyboard Builder/Maths Enjoyer)`**

I'm a software developer and keyboard enthusiast crunching my way through learning as much as I can about the wide world of tech, one step at a time. All of my public coding projects have in some part been a venture in exploring some technology out of curiosity, there is little pattern or sense to it other than me seeing something and thinking "hey, this looks cool, how does it work?".

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 I owe thanks for my love of technology to two people. My father, who, when working in telecoms, created an environment in which I was able to freely play with whatever technology was around at the time, allowing my unabated curiosity to wander. And my first programming teacher, who at the age of 17, gently introduced me to the basics of C++ and making things appear in a terminal, moving from a basic "hello world" application to my own little text-based RPG game for which I painstakingly drew out the ASCII art.

I began taking a more serious look at programming once at university, where I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. While much of this flew by in the whirlwind of trying to keep my head above water with grades, I really treasured some of the lecturers I had who opened my eyes to the world of functional and concurrent programming with Erlang and Haskell. This was the "penny drop" moment for me. Seeing recursive operations and the way memory became incredibly clear to look at with the head | tail construct gave me the boost in confidence I needed, as well as a million more questions.

In my final year, I pivoted into focusing on Machine Learning, with a heavy emphasis on the underlying foundational mathematics in neural networks, learning Linear Algebra and going over the fundamental principles of different loss-reduction functions like Stochastic Gradient Descent, as well as the way this entire field as a concept overlaid our existing model of brains as neural networks. This is still very much an area of interest to me, and here I also owe gratitude to my lecturers in both Machine Learning and Philosophy who sparked another entire avenue of reading for me in the philosophy of mind.

Following graduation and entering the professional and enterprise world of software development, my focus has been on developing highly available and performant microservices in Golang, which is an area I greatly enjoy learning about. However, I also spend a great deal of my free time exploring different technologies and spinning up projects (some get kept around, most gather dust). Some recent favorites include an interpreter in Golang and a new one diving into Graphics Programming with OpenGL, in which I intend to effectively render fractals and have them zoom neatly in and out.
